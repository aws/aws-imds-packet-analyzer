# Introduction

The AWS ImdsPacketAnalyzer is a tool that traces TCP interactions with the EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). This can assist in identifying the processes making IMDSv1 calls on a host. Traces contain the `pid`, the `argv` used to launch the process, and the parent `pids` up to four levels deep. This information allows you to identify a Process making IMDSv1 calls for further investigation.

The ImdsPacketAnalyzer leverages the [BCC (BPF Compiler Collection)](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#Amazon-Linux-2---Binary). In order to successfully run the analyzer the BCC pre-requisites need to be installed.

# Packages - Installing BCC
For hosts with internet access, the install script can be used. It is advised that this script is run only on non-production instances. Installation will update dependancies and may affect other functionality.
For instances without internet access you will need to share the files on an S3 folder.
```
sudo bash install-deps.sh
```

## Usage 
BCC requires that the analyzer is run with root permissions. Typically, you can execute the following script and IMDS calls will be logged to the console and to a log file by default (see [logging.conf](#log-configuration)).
```
sudo python3 src/imds_snoop.py
```


#### Example v1 call:
The following IMDSv1 curl command
```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```
will result the following IMDS packet analyzer output
```
IMDSv1(!) (pid:6028:curl argv:curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/) called by -> (pid:6027:makeCalls.sh argv:/bin/bash ./makeCalls.sh) -> (pid:4081:zsh argv:-zsh) -> (pid:4081:sshd argv:sshd: kianred@pts/0)
```

---

## SLES 15
```
sudo python3 src/imds_snoop.py
```
---

## CentOS 9
```
sudo python src/imds_snoop.py
```
---

## WINDOWS
- From the Working directory E.g ```cd C:\<Users>\<Administrator>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\scripts```
- Run to view IMDSv1 calls: ```metabadger cloudwatch-metrics --region us-east-1```

The output table will highlight if the instance has made IMDSv1 calls

To find the specific app making the IMDSv1 calls, use the inbuilt Windows Resource Monitor Network monitor to find the Image and PID of the application making calls.

To do this, open Resource Monitor (Start->Search ->Resource Monitor) and click on the Network tab.
Then look for calls in the Network Activity section made to either the IP or DNS entries listed:
- IP: ```169.254.169.254```
- DNS: instance-data.<region>.compute.internal E.g ```instance-data.us-east-1.compute.internal```

Network Analyzer will show the calls and you should proceed to update the software/application.

# Logging
The ImdsPacketAnalyzer will also capture IMDS calls to log files. Log entries follow the format: `[Time] [Level] [message]` where:
- **Time:** the time at which the IMDS call was made in the format: `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` eg.) [2022-12-20T12:57:51]
- **Level:** the level of the log entry, where IMDSv2 calls are logged at `INFO` level and IMDSv1 calls are logged at `WARNING` level
    - If there are any instances where an ImdsPacketAnalyser fail to interpret the packets, `ERROR` level messages will be traced.
    - **Note** The only reason a call cannot be identified is if the analyzer is unable to find a request payload for the IMDS call, this missing payload means the analyzer will not be able to discern V1 from V2 IMDS calls. (see what to do in case of missing payload below).
    - Errors (due to a *missing payload*) in the log indicate that the analyzer was not able to capture the payload that was sent to the IMDS ip.  This is expected for AL2 kernel 4.14 on Graviton (ARM) instances (see "Limitations" heading below).   If this is a new error case, please log a defect with detailed information and consider alternative ways to identify the source of the IMDS call.
- **message:** the details of the IMDS call as it would be outputted to the terminal

Example of a IMDSv1 log entry:
```
[2022-12-20T11:03:58] [WARNING] IMDSv1(!) (pid:1016:curl argv:curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/) called by -> (pid:1015:makeCalls.sh argv:/bin/bash ./makeCalls.sh) -> (pid:32678:zsh argv:-zsh) -> (pid:32678:sshd argv:sshd: )
```
Example of a IMDSv2 log entry:
```
[2022-12-20T11:03:58] [INFO] IMDSv2 (pid:1018:curl argv:curl -H X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: AQAEAFEOMInKb-S7me-hLqzu83lYdeDV7r-sPh2D4SJF6v5IwD4S8g== -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/) called by -> (pid:1015:makeCalls.sh argv:/bin/bash ./makeCalls.sh) -> (pid:32678:zsh argv:-zsh) -> (pid:32678:sshd argv:sshd: )
```

### Log configuration

The logging configuration can be adjusted by editing the **logging.conf** file.

By default:
- Logs will be saved to the `/var/log/imds/` folder in a file called `imds-trace.log`
- Log files will be appended (if the analyzer is stopped and then run again on multiple occasions)
- Each log file will reach a maximum size of 1 megabyte before rollover occurs
- When a log file reaches 1mb in size it will rollover to a new log file **i.e) imds-trace.log.1 or imds-trace.log.2** 
- Rollover occurs a maximum of 5 times meaning that at most log files will at most take up 6 x 1mb => 6mb storage space (the prominent `imds-trace.log` file + 5 rollover log files `imds-trace.log.x` where x ranges from 1 to **backupCount**)

### Analyzing log files
**Assuming default logging setup:** 
- Running the command `cat /var/log/imds/imds-trace.* | grep WARNING` will output all IMDSv1 calls to the terminal. 
- Note that this grep will only identify the call, sometimes the calls leading up to the V1 call can provide additional context.   

# Running the tool as a service

## Activating the tool as a service
Configuring the analyzer to run as a service will ensure that the tool will run as soon as possible upon the boot up of an instance. This will increase the chances of identifying services making IMDSv1 calls as early as the instance is inited onto a network. 

A shell script has been provided in the package that will automate the process of setting up the analyzer tool as a service. **Note:** the script/service will only work if the structure of the package is left unchanged. 

Run the script from the command line as follows:

```
sudo ./activate-tracer-service.sh
```

or

```
sudo bash activate-tracer-service.sh
```

The permissions for the shell script may need to be changed using:
```
chmod +x activate-tracer-service.sh
```

You can check if the service is running after activating the service or a host reboot:
```
systemctl status -l imds_tracer_tool.service
```

## Deactivating the tool as a service
When the tool is configured as a service using the previous script, a service file is added into the OS. In order to restore the system, run the script from the command line:

```
sudo ./deactivate-tracer-service.sh
```

or

```
sudo bash deactivate-tracer-service.sh
```

Permissions for the script may need to be changed:
```
chmod +x deactivate-tracer-service.sh
```

---

## Limitations
We are aware of some limitations with the current version of the ImdsPacketAnalyzer.  Contributions are welcomed.
- The `install-deps.sh` script assumes AL2 and internet connectivity
- Althought the ImdsPacketAnalyser have been run on multiple distributions, it is only tested on AL2 before new commits are pushed.
- ImdsPacketAnalyzer only supports IPv4
- ImdsPacketAnalyzer is intended to be used to identify processes making IMDSv1 calls. There is no guarantee that IMDS calls will be detected.  Also be aware that a network can be configured to route other (non-IMDS) traffic to the IMDS ip address. The analyzer is not reliable enough to be used to alarm or audit IMDSv1 calls.
- ImdsPacketAnalyser has not been tested with production traffic in mind, it is intended to be run as a analysis tool to be removed once the source of IMDSv1 calls have been identified.
- AL2 kernel 4.14 on Graviton (ARM) lack the eBPF features required to determine if a call is IMDSv1 or V2.  This is reported as `{MISSING PAYLOAD}` error.  We do not have a workaround for this and do not have a planned fix.
